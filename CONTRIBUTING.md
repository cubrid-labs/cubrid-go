# Run tests (excluding integration)
go test -v -short ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -v -short -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

### Integration Tests (Requires CUBRID)

```bash
# Start a CUBRID container
docker compose up -d

# Set the connection URL
export CUBRID_TEST_DSN="CUBRID:localhost:33000:testdb:::"

# Run integration tests

## Code Style

This project follows standard Go conventions.

### Tools

- **Formatter**: `go fmt` / `gofmt`
- **Linter**: `go vet`
- **Static analysis**: [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) (recommended)

### Running Checks

```bash
# Format
gofmt -w .

# Vet
go vet ./...

# Lint (if golangci-lint is installed)
golangci-lint run
```

### Conventions

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write godoc comments for exported types and functions
- Keep functions small and focused

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature main
   ```

2. **Write tests** for any new functionality.

3. **Run the full test suite** and ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. **Run lint checks**:
   ```bash
   make lint
   ```

### PR Content

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Write a clear title and description explaining _what_ and _why_.
- Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #42`).
- Update documentation if your change affects the public API.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of your change.

### Review Process

- All PRs require at least one review before merge.
- CI must pass (vet, tests).
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly approved.
